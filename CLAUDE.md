# game-arena

The reference game. Read `../../CLAUDE.md` first for the family-wide rules; this file
is what is specific to using them together.

## Why this project exists

Nine addons each pass their own suite, and **every one of those suites runs one addon
with the others absent**. dot-platform makes the point in its own notes and it is the
lesson of every bug this family has found: *a code path only one deployment shape
reaches is a code path nothing has run.*

game-arena is the deployment shape where dot-fps-controller, dot-combat, dot-loadout,
dot-match and dot-ui are all present at once. It is a game, and it is also the only
test of the joins between them.

## One description, three representations

`ArenaMap` holds a list of `AABB`s. `to_scene()` makes meshes and static bodies,
`to_fps_body()` makes a `DotFpsFlatBody`, `to_trace()` makes a `DotTraceFlat`.

Building those independently is the obvious approach and it is wrong in a way nothing
reports: the server's idea of a wall moves a metre and shots start passing through
something clients can see. The self-test asserts all three have the same box count and
that a shot at the perimeter stops at it.

It is also why a dev-textured game is easy to reason about: the geometry *is* the
gameplay, and there is not a separate art pass that could disagree with it.

The texture is generated (`ArenaMap.dev_texture`) and triplanar-mapped, because a
`BoxMesh` UV-maps every face to the same 0..1 square — without triplanar a two-metre
box and a forty-metre wall show the same number of grid squares, and the texture stops
telling you anything about scale, which is its only job.

## One id space

`ArenaPlayer.player_id` is the scoreboard key, the combat entity id, the damage
attribution and the loadout key. dot-server's `session.userid` feeds it.

Two things fall out of that:

- `DotArsenal.attacker_id()` defaults to the parent node's *instance id*, which is a
  fourth id space. `ArenaPlayer.PlayerArsenal` overrides it. Without that, damage
  arrives attributed to a number no scoreboard has ever heard of.
- The loadout key is `"arena-player-%08d"`, not `str(id)`. `DotLoadoutKey.is_usable`
  has a minimum length, so a bare `"7"` is refused before any store sees it — and the
  check exists so a malformed key can never reach a filesystem path. Padding is right;
  loosening the check is not.

**Use the session id, never the peer id.** A peer id is reassigned the moment someone
reconnects, and everything downstream would be handed to the next player to join.
`ArenaModule._add` says so at the point it matters.

## Order inside a tick

`ArenaGame.tick()` and `ArenaPlayer.simulate_tick()` both have an order that is not
arbitrary:

1. **Movement, then the shot.** Half a tick of movement at arena speeds is fifteen
   centimetres, which at range is a miss.
2. **Spread inputs pushed from the simulated state**, never read from a rendered one.
   An interpolated position differs between client and server by design.
3. **Aim from the movement command**, not a second sample. Sampling the mouse twice
   gives a shot that leaves at a different angle than the player was looking along.
4. **All shots resolved after everyone has moved**, so a shot is traced against the
   world as it ends the tick.
5. **The match ticks last**, so a kill scored this tick can end the round this tick
   rather than the next one.

## Where the seams are, and what they cost

Every join between two addons is a few lines, and each is a few lines *because* the
addons refuse to know about each other:

| Join | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| loadout → combat | `ArenaPlayer.give_loadout`, a table from item id to `DotWeapon` |
| combat → match | `ArenaGame._on_entity_killed`, `entity_killed` → `report_kill` |
| match → loadout | `ArenaGame._on_respawn_due` → `_apply_loadout_deferred` |
| movement → combat | `arsenal.movement/airborne/crouched` pushed from `DotFpsState` |
| match → ui | `ArenaHud._on_kill`, a `DotKillFeed.Entry` → coloured fragments |
| game → server | `ArenaModule`, the only file that names dot-server |

`_on_entity_killed` passes `""` for a world death rather than `"0"`. dot-match reads an
empty killer key as "the world"; `"0"` would create a scoreboard record for a player
who does not exist.

`_apply_loadout_deferred` does not await inside the respawn handler. A loadout comes
from a store, which may be slow; a respawn may not be. The player is in the world with
whatever they had and the loadout arrives a frame later.

`apply_loadout` falls back to the default on *any* failure. An unreachable loadout
store is a reason to give someone a rifle, not a reason to leave them watching.

## Movement is a game's choice

`ArenaPlayer.arena_tunables()` is fast, floaty, high air control, and has no sprint.
None of it is dot-fps-controller's default — the addon ships numbers that feel like a
modern shooter, and this is a deliberate departure. The air-acceleration and
wish-speed-cap pair is the classic formula: it does nothing when you hold forward and
everything when you turn while strafing.

Health does not regenerate, for the same kind of reason: regeneration turns every fight
into a question of who disengages first, which is a different game.

## The netcode bridge

`ArenaNetBridge` is the only file that names both `ArenaGame` and `DotNetManager`, and it
is a file rather than a few lines because **the ordering is the hard part**. dot-net
simulates per entity; this game's tick order is a whole-game property. Those two facts
meet in `ensure_game_ticked`: the first `_net_simulate` on a given tick drives the entire
game and the rest find it done.

Three things in it that are not obvious:

- **`Authority.SHARED`, not `SERVER`.** The server stays authoritative and corrects; the
  owning client predicts. `DotNetIdentity.is_predicted()` is false for any other
  authority, so `SERVER` would mean a player seeing their own movement a full round trip
  late.
- **The acknowledgement rides the input packet.** dot-net owns no client-to-server
  channel, so `encode_ack()` produces four fixed-width bytes that go in front of the
  bit-packed command — in front, because a bit-packed command is not fixed width and a
  reader that had to skip it would have to decode it first.
- **The server tick calls `ensure_game_ticked` again afterwards.** A server with no
  players registered runs no behaviours at all, and the match clock still has to advance.

`ArenaPlayerNet` resolves `DotFpsNetSync` and `DotCombatNetSync`'s specs against
`DotNetVar.Type`, which is the whole of why neither addon has to know dot-net exists.
Ammunition is declared `to_owner_only()` — not a bandwidth saving: exact ammunition is
information an opponent should not have, and data never sent cannot be read out of a
modified client.

**`receive_snapshot` must not reconcile.** `DotNetManager.receive_snapshot` already routes
a predicted entity's state to `DotNetPredictor.reconcile` rather than applying it, and
acknowledges the inputs it covers. This file used to do a second pass on top of that,
replaying the same inputs against values that had already been rewound. Nothing failed —
the client still converged, because the second replay started from the first one's answer
— and the only visible cost was in the number that exists to measure exactly this:
`correction_rate()` read **0.500** with the extra pass and **0.032** without. A rate near
a half is what `DotNetPredictor` documents as "the two simulations disagree, and no
smoothing will fix that". Found from `dot-2d-hungry`, whose bridge was written from this
one and inherited it.

## Two examples, two deployment shapes

**`headless_match`** drives an `ArenaGame` directly. No socket, no netcode, no
rendering. Four bots aim at whoever is nearest and hold the trigger, which is enough to
produce kills, deaths, respawns and blocked shots. It asserts what happened *and* what
did not: nobody fell through the floor, nobody left the room, and the geometry actually
blocks shots — that last one because if the trace ignored the map, every other check
would still pass while proving nothing.

**`headless_net`** runs a server and a client in one process over a loopback that can
drop packets, and checks the netcode: the wire round-trips, a spawn is mirrored, movement
replicates, prediction moves the client on the tick it presses, and the two stay together
under loss.

**`dedicated`** boots a real `DotServer` and loads `ArenaModule`. It does not connect a
client: dot-platform runs that seam with a real `DotClientLink` over a real socket, and
`dot-2d-hungry`'s `sandbox` now runs it with a game's own RPCs on top. Repeating it here
would test dot-server rather than this game.

Two bugs the interface checks found, both of which parsed cleanly:

- `initial_focus = button.get_path()` in a screen built before it is registered. The
  node is not in the tree, so `get_path()` errors and returns nothing — and the menu
  then opens with nothing focused, which is unusable with a gamepad and invisible with
  a mouse.
- A HUD built after kills had already happened showed an empty feed. That is also
  exactly what a client joining a match in progress sees, which is why the fix is
  `ArenaHud.catch_up()` rather than a reordered test.

## Validating changes

```bash
cd godot/game-arena
for pair in dot_core:dot-core dot_net:dot-net dot_server:dot-server \
            dot_fps_controller:dot-fps-controller dot_combat:dot-combat \
            dot_loadout:dot-loadout dot_match:dot-match dot_ui:dot-ui; do
  ln -s "../../${pair##*:}/addons/${pair%%:*}" "addons/${pair%%:*}"
done

godot --headless --path . --import
find . -name '*.gd' -not -path './.godot/*' -not -path './addons/*' | while read f; do
    godot --headless --path . --check-only --script "res://${f#./}"
done
godot --headless --path . res://examples/headless_match.tscn
godot --headless --path . res://examples/headless_net.tscn
godot --headless --path . res://examples/dedicated.tscn
```

75 + 62 + 21 checks.

**Re-run `--import` after adding any script with a new `class_name`.** Without it the
identifier does not resolve, the scene fails to load, and the process *hangs* rather
than exiting — nothing reaches `get_tree().quit()`. That happened while writing this
and cost two timed-out runs before the log was read.

**Run both examples after changing any dot-* addon.** That is what this project is for.

## Things deliberately not here

- **Netcode over a real socket.** `ArenaNetBridge` exists and `headless_net` runs it over
  a loopback, but nothing here opens a socket or wires the bridge into `ArenaModule` —
  the dedicated server still ticks `ArenaGame` directly. `dot-2d-hungry` does the whole
  thing, `HungryModule` included, and is what this would copy from.
- **Projectiles.** The rocket launcher is declared as `Delivery.PROJECTILE` and
  dot-combat records the launch vector without spawning anything. A projectile is a
  replicated entity with a lifetime; the bridge now exists to give it one.
- **Pickups in the world.** dot-loadout ships `DotPickup` and `DotPickupField`; the map
  places none. An arena with weapon and armour pickups is most of what makes map
  control matter, and it is a level-design decision rather than a wiring one.
- **A real client.** No camera rig, no viewmodel, no sound, no input sampling into
  `ArenaGame`. `DotFpsSampler` is the seam; there is no scene a person can play yet.
  `dot-2d-hungry` has the 2D equivalent of all of it — launcher, camera, renderer, HUD,
  chat, touch — and is the shape this would take.
- **Bots worth the name.** `_commands_for_tick` aims at the nearest opponent and holds
  the trigger. It is a test fixture, not an opponent.
- **More than one map.** `ArenaMap.dm_box()` is the only level. A second one is a
  static function.
