## [b]This is the piece every one of the addons says belongs in the game.[/b]
## dot-fps-controller does not know about dot-combat; dot-combat does not know about
## dot-match; none of them knows about the others' node layout. Something has to own
## the wiring, and it is deliberately here rather than in an addon — an addon that did
## it would be an addon that dictates a scene shape.
##
## Built in code rather than as a `.tscn` for the same reason [ArenaMap] is: the
## headless test and the played game must get the same player, and a scene that is
## instantiated in one and hand-built in the other is two players that drift.

# --- Simulation ------------------------------------------------------------

## Advances the player one tick.
