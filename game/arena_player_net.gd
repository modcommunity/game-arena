## The thirty lines dot-fps-controller and dot-combat each say belong in the game.
##
## [b]Neither addon may name a dot-net class.[/b] A script that so much as mentions a
## missing [code]class_name[/code] fails to parse and takes every script that
## references it down with it, so dot-fps-controller has to compile with dot-core
## alone. What each addon ships instead is a [code]*NetSync[/code] class describing
## what to replicate as data — property names, and type names as strings. Resolving
## those strings against [code]DotNetVar.Type[/code] is this file's job, and it is the
## only place in game-arena where the two halves meet.
##
## One behaviour rather than two, because one entity is one player: a second behaviour
## would mean a second set of per-peer baselines and a second declaration block on the
## wire for state that always changes together.

## The player this replicates. Set by [ArenaNetBridge] before registration.

## tick.[/b] A player whose input packet was lost should keep moving in a straight
## line rather than stopping dead and jerking forward when the next one arrives.
## [DotFpsController.simulate_tick] says the same thing about its own
## [code]current_command[/code]; holding it here means a netted player gets that
## behaviour through [method ArenaGame.tick], which substitutes a zeroed command for a
## player with no entry.

# --- Simulation ------------------------------------------------------------

## Advances this player by one tick, on whichever machine is entitled to.
##
## [b]The two sides do not take the same route, and they must not.[/b]
##
## On the authority the whole game has to tick as one: [method ArenaGame.tick] moves
## everybody, then resolves every shot against the world as it is after everyone has
## moved, then ticks the match. Simulating one player here and resolving their shot
## before the next player has moved would put half a tick of movement — fifteen
## centimetres at arena speeds — between the shot and its target. So the first
## behaviour to reach this on a given tick drives the entire game, and the rest find
## it already done and only copy their own state out.
##
## On a predicting client there is exactly one predicted player — this one — so
## calling [method ArenaPlayer.simulate_tick] directly is not a shortcut, it is the
## whole of what a client is entitled to compute. Its shots are discarded: the server
## resolves hits, and a client that resolved its own would be a client that decides
## whether it hit.

##
## Runs for a remote player, where it is the only thing that moves them, and for the
## owning client, where it is the rewind half of reconciliation — the server's answer
## is adopted wholesale and [DotNetPredictor] replays every unacknowledged command on
## top of it. Everything the simulation reads has to be restored, which is why

## Copies the interpolated state onto the player, every frame, on a remote one.
##
## [b]Without this the interpolator's work is thrown away.[/b]
## [method _net_state_applied] runs when a snapshot arrives — 20 times a second — and it is
## the only other place these properties are read. A remote player driven only by that
## moves in 50 ms steps, with the smoothed value sitting in a property nothing reads, and
## the symptom is an interpolator that appears not to work.
##
## Deliberately not the bookkeeping half. [member last_state_tick] is what reconciliation
## rewinds to and the tick here is a *render* tick, behind the server's. dot-net does not
## call this on a predicted entity, which is why the predictor is not fought.
