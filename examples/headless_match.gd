## [b]This is the only place the six addons meet.[/b] dot-fps-controller, dot-combat,
## dot-loadout, dot-match, dot-core and the map all pass their own suites in isolation;
## every one of those suites runs one addon with the others absent. What this runs is
## the joins: a movement state feeding a spread cone, a combat kill becoming a match
## score, a match respawn becoming a loadout, an item id becoming a weapon.

## dot-platform's own notes make the case better than this comment can: **a code path
## only one deployment shape reaches is a code path nothing has run**, and every bug
## found in this family so far was found by running something rather than by reading
## it.

## trigger, which is enough to produce kills, deaths, respawns, blocked shots and a
## match that ends on its score limit.
